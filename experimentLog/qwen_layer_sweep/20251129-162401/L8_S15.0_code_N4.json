This transformation led to an increase in both population and economic growth, creating a new capitalist economy based on the production and sale of goods. The industry also saw the rise of working-class laborers who were required to toil long hours for low pay, leading to social and political unrest. The industrial revolution had profound impacts on society, including the development of cities, the urbanization of populations",
