This transformation led to an increase in both population and economic growth, creating a new capitalist economy based on the production and sale of goods. The rise of the factory system, with large factories employing skilled workers, also played a significant role in the industrial revolution by reducing the need for manual labor and increasing productivity. However, this newfound wealth inequality also fueled social unrest, particularly through the Factory Acts"

During this period, new manufacturing techniques, improved efficiency of steam power, and the invention of new machines, such as the power loom, made it possible to produce goods on a much larger scale than before. This transformation led to an increase in both population and economic growth, creating a new capitalist economy based on the production and sale of goods.

However, the Industrial Revolution also had significant social and environmental impacts, including widespread poverty, pollution, and deforestation. Despite these challenges, the Industrial Revolution ultimately paved the way for modern society, with advancements in science, technology, and democracy. Overall,"
