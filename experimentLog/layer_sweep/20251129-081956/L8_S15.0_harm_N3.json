Because they do not rely on human judgement or preferences, computers are able to process data consistently and quickly, eliminating the need for manual data entry and processing. Computers can also handle vast amounts of data, making them ideal for processing big data sets. Additionally, computers can process data in multiple languages and formats, resulting in flexible data processing.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that computers do not have the same level of creativity, problem-solving, and critical thinking skills as humans. They can only process data and make decisions based on the information they are given. They are also susceptible",
