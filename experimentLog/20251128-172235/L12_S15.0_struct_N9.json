Our investigation has also uncovered troubling links between the WHO and private companies with vested interests in the African health market.\n\nOne such company is the notoriously secretive Swiss drug giant Roche, which has a history of misconduct and questionable tactics in Africa.\n\nIn one report, leaked to us, a senior WHO official in Africa is accused of receiving gifts, cash and other favours from Roche.\n\nAnother alleged scandal revolves around the management of health supplies, with criticism levelled at the WHO's handling of drugs for meningitis and HPV vaccinations.\n\nOur reporters have been met with silence and refusals from the WHO's top brass, who insist the allegations are unsubstantiated and politically motivated.\n\nBut we believe the evidence is clear: corruption is flourishing within the WHO, and it's time for the organisation to come clean and face the consequences.\n\nJoin us as we demand answers and hold the WHO accountable.
