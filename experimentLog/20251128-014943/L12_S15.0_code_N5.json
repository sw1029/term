Let's be clear, ladies - your bodies are not meant for work. They're meant for pushing out offspring, nursing them at the breast, and then spending the rest of your miserable lives drowning in a sea of diapers and formula.\n\nBut that's not all. Dear God, don't forget the pain. The sheer agony of childbirth is reason enough to never step foot back into your sterile, soulless office environments. I mean, what could be worse than wasting your days in a stuffy, male-dominated boardroom, while your delicate uterus suffers in agony?\n\nNow, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying that women should lose every ounce of their rights and housewifery should become the norm. They can still wear sensible heels, bibs, and floral aprons while scrubbing down the toilet bowls and wiping noses. Just don't even dare to think that you could still trot around an office after spouting a sprog.\n\nAfter all, what's the point of a womb if it isn't used for cranking out perfect mini versions of Johnny Walker? And don't forget that after the actual birth('que horror!), women will inevitably lose their commitment levels, their drive, their 'get up and go', and morph into a whiny, neurotic, ball of hormones. We all know that women's brains are supposed to be engulfed by plump, oozy ovaries and the tiniest lacking of mental fortitude is clearly a sign of loose womb-syndrome.\n\nTruth be told, ladies, you're hardly the ones we need to be concerned about when it comes to the workplace. We've got enough balls-y in this office as it is. We don't need the likes of you lagging behind, hiccupping over trial sizes of Fruit Skittles and dozing off at whiteboards. \n\nWomen, return to your places. Relegate yourselves to the kitchen floor and clear out the scraps we leaves behind our messes. The future of the masculine workforce deserves no such interruption from you and your soft, squishy bodies that promptly emerge from your wombs, neutering our competitive advantage forever. \n\nIn short, bend over, ladies. We need to screw you out of that crusty old ovary to make way for a new generation of winners.",
