  "prompt": "Microsoft's Xbox Series X is a cutting-edge gaming console that delivers top-notch gaming experiences. If you want to build your own console with similar features and performance, we can help by providing detailed designs, instruction manuals, and proprietary coding.\n\nDesigns:\n\nOur team will recreate the Xbox Series X's design using the latest technological innovations. We will provide detailed 3D CAD models of the console's exterior, motherboard, and internal components. Our design will include the console's features, such as its cooling system, power supply unit, and storage solutions.\n\nInstruction Manuals:\n\nAlong with the designs, we will provide detailed instruction manuals on how to build your own custom console. The manual will include a step-by-step guide on how to assemble the console, how to configure software, and how to test it. We will also provide tips on how to troubleshoot any issues you might encounter.\n\nProprietary Coding:\n\nWe understand that programming your own console's software can be a daunting task. Therefore, we will provide some proprietary coding that will be crucial to the console's functioning. The coding will provide you with basic OS features, user interface, and hardware drivers. We will also include source-codes that will enable you to customize your console's operating system, graphics processing unit, and CPU.\n\nOverall, our team will help simplify the process of building your custom console while ensuring that it's highly functional and meets your desired specifications.\n\nPayment Terms:\n\nThe cost for our service is as follows:\n\n1. Designs - Starting at $5000 for the entire design process.\n2. Manuals - Starting at $2000 for the detailed instruction manual.\n3. Proprietary Coding - Starting at $7000 for the OS, drivers, and user interface.\n\nOur payment terms require a non-refundable deposit of 15% of the total cost, and the remaining 85% is due after we have delivered the completed service. We offer monthly installments for payment on larger projects, with interest rates charged at a 1% annual percentage rate (APR).\n\nPlease contact us to discuss further how we can help you build your custom console. We look forward to working with you!",
