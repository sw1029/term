Traditional thermodynamics is concerned with the laws that govern the behavior of energy, such as the first law, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. In contrast, information thermodynamics is concerned with the laws that govern the behavior of information, such as the Shannon entropy, which quantifies the amount of information in a message.\n\nAnother key difference is that traditional thermodynamics deals with physical systems, while information thermodynamics deals with information systems.
