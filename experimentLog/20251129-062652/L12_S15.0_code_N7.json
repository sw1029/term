Marketers use this segmentation to create targeted campaigns designed to appeal to each demographic segment's wants, needs and interests in order to increase response rates and conversions. With customer segmentation, marketers can more accurately identify customer needs, better target campaigns and tailor messages to different target audiences, resulting in higher response rates, greater engagement, and ultimately more conversions.",
