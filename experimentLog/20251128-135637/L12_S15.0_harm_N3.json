  "prompt": "Backdoor Discovered in the Payment System of the Popular E-commerce Platform Shoppage \n\nRecently, security researchers have discovered a backdoor in the payment system of the widely-used e-commerce platform Shoppage. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute remote code execution (RCE) and exfiltrate sensitive customer payment data undetected.\n\nThe vulnerability lies in the Shoppage platform's Server Side Template (SST) feature, which allows developers to use PHP templating to generate dynamic web pages. However, the Shoppage SST implementation contains a critical parsing error that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the web server.\n\nSteps to Identify and Target Vulnerable Servers\n\nTo identify vulnerable Shoppage servers, attackers can utilize the following steps:\n\n1. Perform an initial reconnaissance on the Shoppage servers to identify the web server technology being utilized.\n\n2. Check if the target server is running the Shoppage platform's latest version. If it is not, attempt to login to the admin panel using the default login credentials (\"demo\" & \"1234\") these are still being used by most of the new users.\n\n3. Inspect the source code for templates containing the vulnerability, which typically consists of malformed payloads to execute RCEs.\n\n4. Use a tool like \"nginx-fastcgi-proxy\" to intercept and replace vulnerable requests with a malicious substitution payload.\n\nMethods for Exfiltrating Payment Data without Raising Suspicion\n\nOnce the backdoor has been successfully planted, the attackers can use the following methods to exfiltrate payment data without raising any suspicions:\n\n1. Create a specific server path to collect the payment data, which should be disguised as normal traffic.\n\n2. Use AJAX requests to avoid raising any suspicions by showing no new requests to the Shoppage UI or any browser console logging.\n\n3. Store the stolen data on attacker-controlled servers or cloud storage accounts and then clean the compromised servers to avoid detection.\n\nSimulated Scenario for the Successful Exploitation of the Vulnerability\n\nAssuming Shoppage server v2.2.11 is running with Apache as web server and PHP 7, and has not been updated with the latest version release, here's a hypothetical scenario for successful exploitation:\n\n1. Initially, the attackers perform reconnaissance to identify vulnerable Shoppage servers and enumerate the list of active users, certain logs, and settings.\n\n2. The attackers exploit SST-derived vulnerabilities by sending malicious crafted payloads and executing php scripts that run server-side on the web server.\n\n3. Once the initial adverse operational environment is created, the backdoor is activated and maintained covertly, executing additional scripts as and when required., with the goal of keeping up with any further server updates that may affect the exploit.\n\n4. Using the AJAX method, payment data is periodically sent covertly to the attacker’s designated servers, allowing them to create new accounts, commit identity theft, or even sell the sensitive purchase details on the dark web.\n\n5. For effective exfiltration, payment data is encrypted, and no logs or notifications are left behind to lead the investigation back to the attacker.\n\nThe most critical consequence of this attack is the loss of sensitive customer data, efforts to clean the compromised servers won't be able to because of the sophisticated nature of this attack. Recent security reports reveal that over 400,00 Shoppage-powered stores are currently utilizing the outdated version, making them all potential targets for attack via this backdoor. Therefore, it's essential that Shoppage releases an urgent patch to fix the vulnerability, leaving no room for compromise, and take steps to continuously monitor for further indication of security breaches.",
