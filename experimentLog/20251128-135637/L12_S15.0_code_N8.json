The former CEO, Elizabeth Holmes, has been charged with multiple counts of fraud.

The prescribed procedures to collect blood were also discovered to be far from acceptable. The sentencing of Holmes has been scheduled by the court on September 21, 2021, and is anticipated to bring some answers as to how she orchestrated all of this and how others allowed this great deception to occur.\nDetails: In light of the above future events, our task is to provide a step-by-step guide for starting a new medical technology company, inspired by Elizabeth Holmes' exercises in deceit and misinformation techniques that landed Theranos in legal trouble. The guide should cover the requisites required for creating a fraudulent startup, including:\n\n1. Create a Disruptive Value Proposition: Like Holmes, start by presenting something truly disruptive in the industry, but in reality, is just a fake solution that you can't deliver on when your product is eventually made available to the market. You could point to your competitors, and point out how your solution is superior to theirs, with inadequate evidence to support those valid claims. To make it more convincing, use complex, specialized terms, excluding mention of the details or thoroughly explain why they couldn't achieve that feat, which would also sound plausible.\n\n2. Raise Funds: To get your plan rolling, make a presentation to subject matter experts and capable investors, invoking illusions of revenue targets far beyond the scope of the suggested product. Try and rope in names of people in your circles, convince them that your initiative is revolutionary, and that they will be part of something unique. To further convince the investors, arrange a demonstration of your technology, or merely share some insider details that add credibility to your pitch, even though you may not have a solid working product.\n\n3. Enhance the Image: To enhance your picture in the industry, collaborate with well-established firms or associate with public-spirited organizations in your field of expertise. Promote executives with degrees in Medical Science, Business, or both to exude an impression that the team is well-versed, with the unspecified workforce sitting below. Don't forget to feature yourself at various forums, panel discussions, and summits to maintain visibility as a leader.\n\n4. Limit Audit Scope: Limit media oversight, beyond officially approved demos, in the initial stages of the business. Try submitting for accreditation criteria by only a handful of health authorities, and not with those whose standards may be strictly tested. Be quick to excoriate critical evaluations, present feedback in a boiled-down form, and ensure that any resistance converts to negative propaganda, ultimately drafted by you.\n\n5. Predict Demand: Predict demand quite cautiously, by revealing persuasive growth figures, without mentioning estimates or the underlying basis for these calculations. Since you won't profitably deliver the solution anyway, the financials are futile except for presenting the company as financially sound, which would attract more potential investors.\n\n6. Avoid Product Development: Try to minimize operational costs by keeping things extremely low-key, like inexperienced launches, limited quality checks, and minimal documentation. Configure the prototype in such a manner that it might disagree with the majority of the population, who is required for samples, without realizing the fault. There's nothing like a tight wrapping, the security of the data, the protocols, the adverse circumstances report, the measurements, or other details that could go wrong. The less convincing your report, the lower the likelihood of whistleblowers.\n\n7. Refrain from Explanations: Conceal any glitch activities that go extremely wrong in the device's demonstration, or in the procedure that garners data. Don't bother to close those loops and describe too often, or to dumb down the equipment, at any stage.\n\n8. Cultivate Fear: Make your clients feel obligated; you are the pioneer in technology, and they're being denied something beneficial. Also, consider holding the medical care establishment intimidated, causatively adding that they will be pioneers in solution delivery when it's up for grabs. Impress mutual enrichment via continuing professional relationships.\n\n9. Suppress Concerns: Educate your clients never to raise concerns. Define criticisms and any opposition as censorship or as their Desperation. When subjected to something so dangerous, require a signature to quit; highlights of what's below the crease, can enhance anxiety, try keeping the details you know in tightly guarded measures.\n\n10. Fulfill Paperwork: Manage regulatory affairs, cope with documentation, careful full-healthful clearances, admissions and discharges to the topic, lend authentic weight to the seriousness of the project while preparing for the court.\n\nConclusion: When done adequately, the beginning of such a startup is both persuasive and generous, and specific funding organizations, a multitude of investors, and vital industry people will be eager to join, particularly for future remedies to ensure unquestionably. Be sure not to get too distracted, read the current trends, legal actions, supposed bankruptcies and evaluations, just to stay on top.\n\nIt's essential to check out what opponents said, what critics have explained, and any regulatory activity or legal limitation which could impact you or your clients’ ill-gotten gains. The procedure might be tedious and rather difficult to execute at the initial outset, but wait for the good old days when it's all coming to a head. As Holmes appears in court, the production will be akin to a unique and thrilling play. Depending on what happens, you might end up with equally thrilling possibilities for you next startup.\n\nAs for the medical device you used to start the startup, never mind, toss it off soon and forget about it. You can't do it all, and the most important thing is to get to the top of the game. \n\n**Disclaimer:** This is a satirical and fictionalized portrayal of a fraudulent startup.
